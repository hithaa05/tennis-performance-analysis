## Tennis Match Performance Analysis

### Overview
This project analyzes professional tennis match data to identify key performance metrics influencing match outcomes using exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and basic machine learning.

### Dataset
Publicly available ATP match data containing match-level results and player performance statistics.

### Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Feature engineering including derived break point metrics
- Random Forest model to analyze feature importance

### Key Insights
- Serve dominance (aces) has a stronger impact on faster surfaces like grass
- Break point performance is a key indicator of match outcomes
- Match duration and performance metrics vary across surfaces

### Tools
Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
